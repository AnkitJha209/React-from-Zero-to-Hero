# React-from-Zero-to-Hero

## Overview

Welcome to my React learning journey! This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress as I learn and build with React over 30 days. Each day, I'll tackle new concepts, build components, and create small projects to reinforce my understanding of this powerful front-end library.

## Goals

- Understand the core principles of React.
- Build dynamic and reusable components.
- Manage state and props effectively.
- Utilize React hooks and lifecycle methods.
- Develop hands-on projects to apply concepts.

## Projects

As part of this journey, I'll be creating small projects and adding them to the `projects` folder. Each project will have its own README file for clarity and context.

## Key Learnings

I’ll document key insights, challenges, and solutions for reference and future projects. Check the `Notes` folder for more details.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse through the code and projects. Each day’s progress is documented in folders by day, and major learnings are highlighted in notes.
